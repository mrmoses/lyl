# Lose Your Lemmings

This project is the result of the IGDAChicago Game Jam 2012.

Lose Your Lemmings is a HTML5, online multilpayer game built by 6 people in ~30 hours at IGDA Chicago Game Jam 2012.

This project/code is not clean or optimized, but is functional. This game is built on the Canvas Prime engine using NodeJS 0.8.x with Express 3 ad socket.io.

There should be a demo available here: http://t.co/WZykmY7W
However it's on a free tier of dotCloud, so it may not be very reliable.

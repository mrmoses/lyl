# Lose Your Lemmings

Lose Your Lemmings is a HTML5, online multilpayer game built by 6 people at [IGDA Chicago](http://igdachicago.com/) [Game Jam 2012](http://t.co/hTUsmaBh).

There should be a demo available here: http://goo.gl/XJU8F
However it's on a free tier of dotCloud, so there is no uptime guarantee.

This project/code is not clean or optimized, but is functional (built in ~30 hours).

This game is built on the [Canvas Prime](https://github.com/ashblue/canvas-prime) engine using [NodeJS 0.8.x](http://nodejs.org) with [Express 3.x](http://expressjs.com/) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/).
